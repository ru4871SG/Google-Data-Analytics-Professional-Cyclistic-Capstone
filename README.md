# Google Data Analytics Professional Cyclistic Capstone

by Ruddy Setiadi Gunawan

This analysis case study was completed on February 14, 2023. I only included the .Rmd files here.

Shoutout to Isabella Peel, another former student of the same course. Her R Markdown was the best among all students who have completed this case study before me. I decided to use the same easy template that you can also get for free: https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite

I completed the analyses using both R and SQL. Feel free to check the result here: https://ru4871sg.github.io/Google-Data-Analytics-Professional-Cyclistic-Capstone/
