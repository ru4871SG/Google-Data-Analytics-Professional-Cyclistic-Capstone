This case study on Cyclistic is my capstone project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program. My name is Ruddy Setiadi Gunawan, and you can find my report below.

# Introduction
<hr>
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The company launched its bike-sharing offering service in 2016, and it has become popular in the city of Chicago. One of Cyclistic's key features is how its bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to its any other station anytime. 

Cyclistic customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders (or casuals), whereas customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as members. 

As of February 2022, Cyclistic pricing plans are as follow:

- Single-ride: \$1 to unlock, plus \$0.39 per minute
- Full-day pass: \$15/day
- Annual membership: \$10/month

Cyclistic's director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future will depend on maximizing the number of annual memberships. With this objective in mind, the company wants to learn how casual riders and annual members may use Cyclistic services differently, and how to use digital media to convert Cyclistic casual riders to become members.<br><br><br>

# Datasets
<hr>
While Cyclistic is a fictional company, datasets gathered for this analysis come from a real company operating in Chicago called Divvy Bikes.

<a href="https://divvybikes.com/system-data" target="_blank">Divvy trip</a> datasets from January 2022 to December 2022 were used for this analysis.

Each trip includes:

- Trip start day and time 
- Trip end day and time 
- Trip start station 
- Trip end station 
- Rider type

The datasets have been made available under <a href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement" target="_blank">this license</a><br><br><br>

# Methods
<hr>
The datasets were loaded into RStudio, and then previewed, cleaned, filtered, merged, analyzed using multiple libraries, such as `skimr`, `tidyverse`, and `lubridate`. As for data visualization, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `leaflet`, and `rgdal` were all used.<br><br><br>

### Popular Dates and Days

![](vizzes/ggarrange_popular_dates_comparison.png){width="100%"}
The above data viz shows that both casual riders and members like to use Cyclistic service between June and September, which are basically the summer months. It is understandable considering bike services are typically more popular during summer time.

However, there is a big difference between casuals and members. Casuals love to use the bikes on weekends (Friday - Sunday), whereas members' busiest days are between Tuesday and Thursday. From this analysis alone, looks like members prefer to use the bikes for daily routines while casuals use Cyclistic more for leisures and hobbies.

To strengthen this narrative, you can check between November and January, where trip counts for casuals go much lower, but they still look considerably higher for members. 

Daily routines (e.g., work commute) don't always change throughout the year, but people may not really use bikes for leisures and hobbies in the winter months.

To analyze further, let's see how members and casuals compare between the days without including the dates.<br>

Here everything looks clearer. Members use Cyclistic bikes more on weekdays, whereas casuals prefer to use them on weekends. This should confirm our previous analysis regarding how casuals use Cyclistic bikes for hobbies and leisures, and how they don't really use Cyclistic bikes for work commute and other weekday routines.<br><br>
