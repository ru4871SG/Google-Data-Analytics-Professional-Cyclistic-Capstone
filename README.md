# Google Data Analytics Professional Cyclistic Capstone

by Ruddy Setiadi Gunawan

This analysis case study was completed on February 14, 2023.

Shoutout to Isabella Peel, another former student of the same course. Her R Markdown was the best among all students who have completed this case study before me. Since her case study inspired me, I decided to use the same template that you can get for free: https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite

I completed the analyses using both R and SQL. Feel free to check the result here: https://ru4871sg.github.io/Google-Data-Analytics-Professional-Cyclistic-Capstone/
